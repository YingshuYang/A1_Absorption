# A1_Absorption

## Overview
`A1_Absorption` is a computational tool designed to analyze the absorption of laser light within multilayer systems using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) and the Poynting theorem. This software enables the calculation of reflection, transmission, and total absorption rates for multilayer structures. Additionally, it offers detailed insights into the absorption of each individual layer within the system.

## Features
- **Reflection, Transmission, and Absorption Calculation**: Quantifies the basic optical properties of multilayer systems.
- **Layer-specific Absorption Analysis**: Provides detailed absorption data for each layer, enhancing the understanding of laser-material interaction.

## Physical Background
The underlying physics and mathematical derivations implemented in this code are extensively discussed in Yingshu Yang's thesis:
